        <p>Welcome to my bio site!! </p>
	    <p>My name is Hitomi, moved from Tokyo, Japan in 2014. 
           I have been working for IT companies after graduating collage as COBOL programer and IT technical engineer for some applications. </p>
		<p>I love Snowboarding and Body boarding and I used to go to beaches, mountains everyweekends in Japan. 
			But in the US, I mean after moving to Orlando I didn't do them because... no mountain and higher chances of shark attach than Japan...</p>
		<p>Anyway I'm enjoying my life here, recently many new restaurants open (I love to eat!) which always make me so happy! 
            "JINYA RAMEN BAR", this is also a new place I have to go as soon as possile!</p>
